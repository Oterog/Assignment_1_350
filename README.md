Collaborators: Gabriel Otero, Greyson Weddle, Zack Siegel

Due: 09/26/2024

Objective: <br/>
&emsp; The purpose of this assignment is for you to show that we can write correct SQL query statements, by using the HR database in your PostgreSQL server installation.

Side Notes: <br/>
&emsp; (I.) You are to write SQL statements for the following database queries, using the pgAdmin4 client to your PostgreSQL server. <br/>
&emsp; (II.) Save in a .sql file named like jimmys.sql. <br/>
&emsp; (III.) Do not look up data yourself. For example, in question 4 below, do not look up the actual ID of Nancy Greenberg yourself, and use that number in your query. <br/>
&emsp; (IIII.) Most of the above queries involve joins.

Write with SQL: <br/>

&emsp; (1.) Show the name of each country whose name contains the syllable ‘in’ or ‘In’

&emsp; (2.) Show how many countries there are in each region (show the region id and the count).

&emsp; (3.) Show the first and last names of each employee who is a manager (that is whose job title contains the word ‘Manager’)

&emsp; (4.) Show the first and last name of each employee managed by Nancy Greenberg

&emsp; (5.) Show the first and last name of each employee who is paid more than Luis Popp but less than Alexander Hunold

&emsp; (6.) Show the average salary of the employees working in Germany

&emsp; (7.) Show the average salary of each department that has at least 8 employees (show the department id)

&emsp; (8.) Show the (actual) minimum and maximum salary for programmers

&emsp; (9.) Show the total salary paid to all employees in the Finance department

&emsp; (10.) Show how many employees in the IT department are paid more than the manager of the Shipping department.

&emsp; (11.) Using “set-theory SQL” (that is, one or more of the keywords union, intersect, minus must appear), show the employee id, first name and last name of each employee who is not managed by Nancy Greenberg.

&emsp; (12.) Using “set-theory SQL”, show the employee id and last names of all employees paid more
than 9000 or who work in Germany

&emsp; (13.) Using “set-theory SQL”, show the countries in region 4 whose names begin with the letter ‘Z’.
